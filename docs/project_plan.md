## Milestones & Tasks

### Phase 1: YubiKey Registration & Authentication
- [x] Set up persistent SQLite database for user, credential, and challenge storage (replace in-memory storage)
- [x] Verify YubiKey recognition and WebAuthn capabilities
- [x] Implement backend API endpoints for YubiKey registration and authentication (/auth/begin-registration, /auth/complete-registration, /auth/begin-authentication, /auth/complete-authentication)
- [x] Implement client-side registration and authentication flows in React
- [x] Test YubiKey registration and authentication (unit/integration)

### Phase 2: Seed Generation & Validation
- [ ] Implement BIP39 seed generation module
- [ ] Validate and import seed phrases using checksum verification
- [ ] Convert mnemonic phrases to binary seeds
- [ ] Test seed generation and validation logic

### Phase 3: Seed Encryption & Storage
- [ ] Develop encryption/decryption utilities using AES-256-GCM
- [ ] Implement envelope encryption with proper key derivation (HKDF-SHA256)
- [ ] Integrate SQLite database for encrypted seed and credential storage
- [ ] Test encryption, storage, and access control

### Phase 4: Seed Retrieval & Decryption
- [ ] Implement backend and frontend logic for seed retrieval and decryption after YubiKey authentication
- [ ] Test retrieval and decryption with correct and incorrect credentials

### Phase 5: YubiKey Management
- [ ] Implement endpoints and UI for listing, adding, and removing registered YubiKeys
- [ ] Test YubiKey management and access control

### Phase 6: User Interface (Wizard Flow)
- [x] Registration/authentication UI and API integration
- [ ] Build a wizard-style UI for registration, seed generation/import, encryption/storage, retrieval, and YubiKey management
- [ ] Integrate API services for seed flows
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS configuration for local development
- [ ] Test end-to-end user journey and UI feedback

### Phase 7: Security & Session Management
- [ ] Enforce HTTPS, secure session handling, and timeouts
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and standardized error responses
- [ ] Test security features and simulate attack scenarios

### Phase 8: Integration Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create and document end-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Perform cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] Update test scripts and resolve any issues

### Phase 9: Documentation & Developer Guides
- [ ] Consolidate all project documentation into the new structure (partial)
- [ ] Write comprehensive API interface documentation (partial)
- [ ] Create a developer guide for module organization and coding conventions (partial)
