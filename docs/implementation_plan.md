# Implementation & Migration Plan

## Environment Setup
1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using `uv`.
   - Organize the backend code into directories: `api`, `services`, `models`, and `utils`.
   - Configure HTTPS for local testing (self-signed certificate for `https://localhost:5001`).

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Initialize a React application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
   - Set up a proxy in `package.json` to route API calls to the Flask backend.

## Migration & Restructuring
- **Directory Restructuring**:  
  - Move existing Flask code into the new `backend` structure.
  - Split `app.py` into modular components (API endpoints, services, etc.).
  - Establish clear module boundaries and update all imports.

- **Configuration**:
  - Consolidate all configuration settings into a `config.yaml` file.
  - Update the application to load configuration from this file.

- **Database Migration**:
  - Migrate from file-based storage to a SQLite database.
  - Initialize the new schema and verify data integrity using provided scripts.

## Deployment
- **Development Scripts**:  
  - Create shell scripts (e.g., `dev.sh` and `build.sh`) for starting the backend and frontend.
  - Ensure HTTPS is properly configured and the React build is served by Flask in production.

## Testing
- Consolidate and update test scripts for:
  - WebAuthn registration and authentication (detailed in the test guides).
  - End-to-end workflows: seed generation, storage, and retrieval.
  - Unit and integration tests for API endpoints and services.
