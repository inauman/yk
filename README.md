# YubiKey Bitcoin Seed Storage â€“ Proof of Concept

## Overview
This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept for protecting a Bitcoin seed phrase using YubiKeys. The system implements a 2-of-3 multisig scheme where a user can secure their Bitcoin seed by associating one or more YubiKeys along with a software (app) key.

## Key Features
- **Seed Generation & Validation**: Generates BIP39-compliant seed phrases.
- **YubiKey Registration & Authentication**: Uses WebAuthn for secure, hardware-backed key management.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Implements an encryption flow (AES-256-GCM with envelope encryption) to secure seed data.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between the Flask backend and React frontend, with well-defined API interfaces.
- **Task Tracking**: A dedicated project plan for managing and updating tasks.

## Quick Start
1. **Backend Setup**: Navigate to the `backend` directory, create a virtual environment, install dependencies (using `uv`), and run `python app.py`.
2. **Frontend Setup**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory, install Node.js dependencies, and start the React development server.
3. **Access**: Open your browser and visit `https://localhost:5001`.
